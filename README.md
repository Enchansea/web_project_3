# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Plans
* Website


**Intro**

This is my third website project. Inside are elements of HTML and CSS. The project is about traveling across the US. Each section focuses on a different elements to gain more skill and real world practice. In this project I explored grid layout to display pictures and paragraphs. I also used @media inquiries to make the website viewable on different screen sizes. Namely: 1280, 1024, 768, and 320.

**Plans**

I plan on including a form, add widgets, and play video/audio. I would also like to add some javascript elements to explore what I can do in that area.
